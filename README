#Application
A full-stack application built with FastAPI, React, and PostgreSQL, containerised using Docker Compose. It supports secure user creation, retrieval, and deletion, with JWT-based authorization to ensure only the frontend can access backend endpoints.

#Clarification
Data is calculated using the backend, this convention was decided upon due to "A user has the following attributes - age" therefore I am storing age in this database. However, a runner or similar would need to be used to update these dates as it is currently. Without this requirement I would have just stored DOB and ran a client side calculation to reduce server burden.

#Setup
Clone the repo to a local area
This requires a .env file, place this in the origin directory where it is saved
Feel free to change the data if preferred or just copy paste, an example is below:

##.env 
POSTGRES_USER=user
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=secureVery888Secure()
POSTGRES_DB=db
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:secureVery888Secure()@db:5432/db
